The Installer
-------------

This CD features a complete graphical environment, provided that your
video card and mouse were correctly detected. To start the graphical
mode, type in:

   startx

In the desktop, you will find the "Install GoboLinux" icon. Just click
it and follow the instructions to have the system installed into your
hard disk.

As a failsafe, we also provide an interactive text-based frontend for
the installer. You can launch it by typing:

   Installer

Note: remember that before you install, you need an available partition.
You can edit your partition table clicking on 'QtParted' on the desktop
or using 'cfdisk' on the console.

..............................................................................

Installing additional packages
------------------------------

Lots of packages are available at http://www.gobolinux.org.
You can install a new program running a command such as

    InstallPackage Gimp

At the end of the installation, you will be informed on what other packages
are necessary for this application to run (eg, to use KDE you'll have to
install, among others, XFree86).

To install packages from the Live-CD (after booting from the HD), you must
mount the 'squashfs' file that contains the image from the Live-CD system.
To do that, first mount the CD:

   mount /Mount/CD-ROM

Then, mount the GoboLinux.suqshfs file:

   mount /Mount/CD-ROM/GoboLinux.squashfs /Mount/SquashFS -t squashfs

Now, you can install the packages that are inside the Live-CD (inside its
Programs directory) using the InstallPackage script, like this:

   InstallPackage /Mount/SquashFS/Programs/KDE

Note 1: after using the squashfs file, you may unmount it:

   umount /Mount/SquashFS

Note 2: To have the dependencies required by an application installed
automatically, use the "--batch" parameter:

   InstallPackage --batch Gimp

   or

   InstallPackage --batch /Mount/SquashFS/Programs/Gimp

Manual installation
-------------------

If for some reason the installer does not work for you neither in X or in
the console, don't despair. You can still install GoboLinux the manual way,
as it was done in previous versions.

STEP 1: The partition

Initially, you will need at least two partitions, one for the system
and one for swap (you can reuse the swap partition of another Linux
distribution).

You'll have to create the partition(s) and format it(them). To create
the partition use cfdisk or, inside the graphical environment, qtparted.
To format it, you can use mkreiserfs or mke2fs.

STEP 2: Mount your new partition

Mount your new partition, using a command such as

   mount /dev/{your partition} /Mount/GoboLinux

STEP 3: Install the system

Now, run the script to copy the system from this CD to the new
partition (which is mounted at /Mount/GoboLinux). There are some predefined
'profiles' located at /Depot/Install. A profile is just a set of programs
that will be installed if you choose it. Currently, they are:
- 'Base': contains only the basic packages for an usable system (350 MB)
- 'Full': contains all programs from this Live-CD (1.5 GB)

Go to /Depot/Install and run the 'ProfileInstall' script, passing the chosen
profile and the mount point used on Step 2. For example:

   ProfileInstall Full /Mount/GoboLinux

STEP 4: Perform some basic configuration

Before you can be able to boot your new GoboLinux system, you'll have to
change a few of the default settings to reflect your system. The file

   /Mount/GoboLinux/System/Settings/fstab

contains the partition list. Configure it as usual. Another file which
you will have to edit is

   /Mount/GoboLinux/Programs/BootScripts/Settings/BootScripts/Options

This file contains configurations for programs that are called at boot
time, such as the system's hostname, mouse configuration and keymap
layout.

By default, GoboLinux features three text editors: MCEdit, which you
can access using the convenient wrapper 'e', Nano (a clone of Pico) and
Vim, for those who don't hate it. Actually, there is a fourth editor:
ed, the Standard Text Editor, but, believe me, you don't want to use this.

STEP 5: Bootloader

Before reboot the system you will need to install a bootloader and
configure it, if you don't have one installed yet. We suggest GRUB.
To install it just run

    grub
      grub> root (hd*,**)
      grub> setup --prefix=/System/Kernel/Boot/grub (hd*)
      grub>quit


*   your GoboLinux HD number: hda is 0, hdb 1, and so on
**  your GoboLinux partition number: 0 is 1, 1 is 2, and so on
*** another tip is that the <tab> key works to complete this number,
    so you can see the choices that you have.

Now you can configure it. Go to /Mount/GoboLinux/System/Kernel/Boot/grub
and edit the menu.lst file. In this file you will find some examples.
Most likely, all you'll need to do is put the same numbers used to install
GRUB in the first example.

STEP 6: Reboot!

If you have installed the bootloader you can remove the cd before the
machine start to boot and boot from the HD.  Welcome to your new system!
Now that your system is already running, you can fine-tune it to suit
your needs. Check out the /System/Settings/BootScripts directory for
settings such  as network configuration, and usual Linux settings such
as /System/Settings/hosts and /System/Settings/resolv.conf.

Ah... the default login is "gobo", and the default password, "gobo".
This is the superuser account (equivalent to "root" in other systems).
We recommend to you creating a regular user account for normal use,
and use the powers of "gobo" only for system administration tasks.
For example, to create a new user called "que", type "AddUser que".
