                        """"""""""""""""


A bit of history
""""""""""""""""

The first installations of GoboLinux were made simply by packing an already
running GoboLinux system (the very first GoboLinux was compiled from scratch)
and unpacking it into an empty partition. After some effort, mainly spent by
Guilherme Bedin (gbedin), we got an bootable CD that runs itself a GoboLinux
system. First, it contained just a basic system, but since version 007 -
inspired by some projects like Knoppix - the Live CD contains a much more
complete system. In this version, the CD experience is greatly enhanced, by
using features such as automatic hardware detection.


Using this LiveCD
"""""""""""""""""

Most of the features of this LiveCD can be directly used (e.g. mounting a
partition, copying and editing files, etc.). In the other hand, using more
advanced features like accessing a network requires some basic
pre-configuration. The directories that contain files that need to be
edited are specially mounted with the "TmpFS" file system: you can modify
them, but when you reboot the machine, the modifications will be lost.
Some guidelines to run XFree86 and connect to a network are presented below.


Basic connection to a network
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To activate your network interface, use 'ifconfig' specifying the interface
identifier (usually eth0) and the IP address of this computer in your LAN.

  ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.25

Having the interface enabled, you can use, for example, 'ftp' or 'ssh' to
access a machine within your network.
