* gobohide doesn't work: root is unionfs, which is apparently unsupported by gobohide at this point
* something wrong with the launch of init
	* no Ctrl-C in livecd
	* no multiple virtual consoles launched
	(after exiting the first terminal, init seems to launch the other consoles.)
* compile usb-storage as a builtin?
* /Glibc with ld.so.cache
* xpm should be stored in Grub recipe
