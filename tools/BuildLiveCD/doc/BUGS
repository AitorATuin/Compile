* LiveCD :
 * gobohide doesn't work: root is unionfs, which is apparently unsupported by gobohide at this point
 * something wrong with the launch of init
   * no Ctrl-C in livecd
   * no multiple virtual consoles launched (after exiting the first terminal, init seems to launch the other consoles.)

* Installed system:
  * ]ping
    ping: unknown protocol icmp.
    can't init ping: No such file or directory
  * Coldplug + Udev: Modules are not being auto-loaded
  * Scripts zsh autocompletions not active
  
* General:
 * compile usb-storage as a builtin?
 * xpm should be stored in Grub recipe
 * EnhancedSkel needs to be updated
