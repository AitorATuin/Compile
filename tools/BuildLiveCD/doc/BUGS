* LiveCD-specific:
 * gobohide doesn't work: root is unionfs, which is apparently unsupported by gobohide at this point
 * something wrong with the launch of init
   * no Ctrl-C in livecd
   * no multiple virtual consoles launched (after exiting the first terminal, init seems to launch the other consoles.)

* Installed/LiveCD systems :
  * ]ping
    ping: unknown protocol icmp.
    can't init ping: No such file or directory
  * Coldplug + Udev: Modules are not being auto-loaded
  * Scripts zsh autocompletions not active
  * ssh needs /var/empty
  * Manager needs to be 're-maked' to work. CompressAndBuildISO should build our tools inside considerind the LiveCD environment, not the host system env.
   
* General:
 * compile usb-storage as a builtin?
 * xpm should be stored in Grub recipe
 * EnhancedSkel needs to be updated (remove xmms icon, prepare a new .kde, ...)
 * Kopete should be compiled (KDE-Network)
 * Recompile GCC with objecitveC support
